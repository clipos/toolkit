[+] Please choose one of the following option to make the cosmk tool available
    in your shell sessions:

    * Source the toolkit/activate script in your current session:

      $ source toolkit/activate

    Or:

    1. Move the 'cosmk' binary to a path already in your \$PATH:

       $ mv '${reporoot}/run/bin/cosmk' ${HOME}/.bin/cosmk # For example

    2. Enable Bash or Zsh completion by adding the following code in your
       '.bashrc' or '.zshrc':

       # Bash
       eval "\$(cd ${reporoot}; cosmk --completion-script-bash)"

       # Zsh
       eval "\$(cd ${reporoot}; cosmk --completion-script-zsh)"
