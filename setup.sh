# Populate the virtualenv with the set of packages we require and vendor:
#
# With the command above (python3 -m venv ...), we "inherit" by default 3
# Python packages from the user's Linux distro: setuptools, pip and wheel.
# (Notice that this is the normal behavior of the venv module in order to
# provide ways for the user to install new packages in its freshly created
# venv). However this behavior can cause potential issues that we do not want
# to hear about (since we do not control the versions of those distro-provided
# packages). But given the fact that we intentionally provide and vendor
# **ALL** the packages to be installed in the virtualenv (including pip,
# setuptools and wheel), we can trick pip into reinstalling them (including
# itself) with **OUR** packages provided and vendored (and with thoroughly
# pinned versions).
#
# The reason why we use --no-index is to prevent pip from fetching packages (or
# any package dependency) from PyPI automatically (and without our knowledge).
# In case of some missing dependencies, this will raise an error and will
# enable us to take action. With those options below, pip only consider the
# packages provided/vendored in $VENDOR, i.e. assets/toolkit (ensure to only
# gather sources packages in this directory).

#
# [2019-04-02] Note/Hack: There is currently a bug in Pip 19 that prevent us
# from using the option "--no-binary :all:" with packages that make use of PEP
# 517 build system (e.g. flit), hence the "--no-use-pep517" flag below that
# will prevent Pip from trying to install such packages.
# This package restriction could be removed once the bug in Pip will be fixed,
