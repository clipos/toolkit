# Script to be sourced to setup the interactive shell environment of the user
# to allow him/her to use the whole CLIP OS toolkit easily (cosmk with the
# shell completion features, our vendored version of just, etc.).

# DISCLAIMER: For now, only Bash and Zsh shells are supported.

# Development guidelines for this file:
#   1. Do NOT call "exit" as this would close the user interactive shell
#      session. Use return!
#   2. Stay POSIX sh compliant for this file (with the exception of the "local"
#      keyword which is understood everywhere).
#   3. Avoid at most the use of external programs (aliases might have been
#      set in the current interactive shell session that could possibly break
#      the expected behavior of some commands).
#   4. Use double-underscore prefixed variable and function names to avoid
#      overwriting potential variables or functions of the user interactive
#      shell.

# Identify the running shell as code will differ if it is either Bash or Zsh:

    echo >&2 "     No other shell is supported. Aborting."

# and infer then the path to the toolkit directory.
