# This is an example of an "instrumentation.toml" file intended to be dropped
# at the root of the CLIP OS source tree (i.e. the "repo" root).
# When existing at the root of the CLIP OS source tree product repository, this
# "drop-in" file changes to the behavior of the recipe actions (mainly the
# "build", "image", "configure" and "bundle" actions) for providing
# instrumentation to the selected recipes.
#
# Note 1: By default, all the recipes of the current product *NOT DECLARED* in
# this file will be produced without instrumentation (i.e. as it would be in a
# normal build intended for production use).
#
# Note 2: If instrumentation is requested for at least one recipe, then the
# product version will be tainted with an "instrumented" tag as a SemVer build
# metadata (e.g. "X.Y.Z+instrumented").

# Recipes that shall be produced instrumented for use by a developer:
#
# For instance, a recipe instrumented in "development" mode may embed tools of
# various nature (such as networking utilities, debuggers, text editors, etc.
# depending on the needs of that recipe) to provide means of analyzing issues
# or means to develop new features or enhance that recipe.
development = [
    "clipos/core",

# Recipes that shall be produced instrumented for debugging investigations:
#
# Usually, this instrumentation level includes the features provided by the
# "development" instrumentation level but goes further as it may also force the
# build of some consequent parts of the recipe to use a compilation mode with
# debugging features (e.g. symbols) for further bug investigations.
