# By default, the project creates images intended for production use. To ease
# development and debug, you can enable instrumentation features that alter the
# behavior of all project actions launched with the cosmk tool.

# Notice: If at least one instrumentation feature is enabled in this file, then
# the product version will be tainted with an "instrumented" tag as a SemVer
# build metadata (e.g. "X.Y.Z+instrumented").
#
# For an in-depth reference of the effects of all instrumentation features
# proposed below, please refer to the appropriate page of the CLIP OS product
# documentation:
# <https://docs.clip-os.org/clipos/development.html#effect-of-instrumentation-levels>
# The other products (i.e. CLIP OS derivatives) may implement or enhance those
# product instrumentation features.
