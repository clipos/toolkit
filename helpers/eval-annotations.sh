ERROR: Missing repo environment variables (REPO_*).

This script is intended to be run via the "repo forall" command, such as:

  $ repo forall [<project>...] -c '${0##*/} [<arg>...]'

Make sure to either use absolute paths for the command to launch or to have
activated the CLIP OS toolkit environment (see the "source_me.sh" file) to
expose the CLIP OS toolkit helper scripts in your PATH. This requirement is
explained by the fact that "repo forall" changes the current working directory
before invoking the specified command (commands are invoked from within each
repo project directory).

See "repo help forall" for more details. The above example is not exhaustive.

#   pull_upstream <annotation-index> <git-remote-URL> <refspecs>

# This function is a callback function to provide to the eval_annotations
# function. It fetches the upstream Git references specified in the refspecs
# string (multiple refspec can be given provided they are whitespace-separated)
# from the Git remote URL and create the expected local branches according to
# the refspecs.
#
# As an example:
#
#   <project name="src_external_linux" path="src/external/linux">
#     <annotation name="UPSTREAM_0_URL" value="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git" />
#     <annotation name="UPSTREAM_0_REFSPECS" value="refs/heads/linux-4.16.y:refs/heads/upstream/stable-4.16 refs/tags/v*:refs/tags/v*" />
#     <annotation name="UPSTREAM_1_URL" value="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git" />
#     <annotation name="UPSTREAM_1_REFSPECS" value="refs/heads/master:refs/heads/upstream/master refs/tags/v*:refs/tags/v*" />
#   </project>
#
# This configuration creates two new remotes (upstream0 and upstream1), fetch
# their references and create the local branches according to the given
# refspecs. The syntax in the refspecs string follows what is accepted by the
# command "git fetch" (see chapter "Git Internals - The Refspec" of the Git
# Book for more details).
