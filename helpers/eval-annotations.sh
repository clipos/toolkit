Make sure to either use absolute paths for the command to launch or to have
activated the CLIP OS toolkit environment (see the "activate" file) to expose

# mapping).
# As a consequence, this enables the developer to update the dedicated local
# branches (meant to track the upstream projects for development convenience)
# automatically when doing a "git fetch <upstream-remote-name>".
# Multiple refspecs can be given for an upstream provided they are
# whitespace-separated.
# The syntax in the "refspecs" string follows what is accepted by the command
# "git fetch" (see chapter "Git Internals - The Refspec" of the Git Book for
# more details).

# As an example, the following configuration:
#
#   <project name="src_external_linux" path="src/external/linux">

# updates the local branches "upstream/stable-4.16" and "upstream/master" (as
